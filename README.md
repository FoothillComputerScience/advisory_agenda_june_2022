# New Certificate
## Certificate of Achievement in Web Development
The goal of the Certificate of Achievement in Web Applications Development is to prepare individuals to create 
web applications that meet the needs of clients and end users (such as individuals, institutions, businesses, 
and community organizations). Students successful in this program will be able to design, develop, and deploy 
websites that use modern technology and techniques. They will be able to create rich dynamic web applications 
that deliver similar features and functions previously associated with desktop applications through the use of 
modern libraries or frameworks. They will be able to create responsive web pages for devices of various screen 
sizes and contexts. They will be able to effectively utilize both client and server side programming for 
websites that are data-driven.
